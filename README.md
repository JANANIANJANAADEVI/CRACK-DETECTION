# CRACK-DETECTION
# DESCRIPTION
      Every year, millions of dollars are spent on crack detectionÂ in important infrastructure parts like
      buildings, bridges, and highways. If crack identification is done manually with visual inspection, 
      it is an extremely time-consuming operation. More and more machine learning techniques are being
      used to guarantee improved performance results.
